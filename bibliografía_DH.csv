Stephen Ramsay's intriguing study of computational text analysis examines how computers can be used as ""reading machines"" to open up entirely new possibilities for literary critics. Computer-based text analysis has been employed for the past several decades as a way of searching, collating, and indexing texts. Despite this, the digital revolution has not penetrated the core activity of literary studies: interpretive analysis of written texts. Computers can handle vast amounts of data, allowing for the comparison of texts in ways that were previously too overwhelming for individuals, but they may also assist in enhancing the entirely necessary role of subjectivity in critical interpretation. Reading Machines discusses the importance of this new form of text analysis conducted with the assistance of computers. Ramsay suggests that the rigidity of computation can be enlisted in the project of intuition, subjectivity, and play.","2011","2016-06-20 18:52:20","2016-06-20 18:52:20","","","114","","","","","Reading Machines","","","","","University of Illinois Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.com.co/books?id=NvzXvyIrHtYC","","Computers / Desktop Applications / Desktop Publishing; Computers / Software Development & Engineering / General; Language Arts & Disciplines / Rhetoric; Literary Criticism / Books & Reading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, most humanists and social scientists do not work with big data. They do not deal with millions of documents. Literary critics’ corpora are the handful of works produced by an author. The historians’ primary source documents number in the tens, perhaps hundreds. Social scientists deal with tens or hundreds of transcripts of focus groups and in-depth interviews, or at most a few thousand media articles. And they analyze these data either qualitatively or quantitatively with a variety of manual or computer-assisted methodologies, from content analysis to frame analysis, discourse analysis, quantitative narrative analysis. But, once developed, at least some of the NLP tools of automatic textual analysis and the data analytics visualization tools, can be applied not just to big data but to small data as well. This paper illustrates how some of these tools can be used by focusing on a short first-person narrative. And the NLP tools reveal patterns of language use perhaps not immediately discernible, thus proving useful in the analysis of even small data. But understanding and interpreting these patterns requires knowledge way beyond the NLP tools themselves. Humanists and social scientists need not fear computer scientists; rather, they need to learn to take advantage of them. NLP tools lay a bridge between quality and quantity, with much to be gained from a constant interaction between distant and close reading.","2020-11-11","2021-01-22 21:17:33","2021-01-22 21:17:33","2021-01-22 21:16:32","","","","","","Qual Quant","What’s in a text?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\jairo\Zotero\storage\DRWM5GY4\Franzosi - 2020 - What’s in a text Bridging the gap between quality.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
